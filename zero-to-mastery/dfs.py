# use in graph/tree traversal

# root node
# has lower memory requirement than bfs
# start and finish the left side first (deep)
# left until deep to right deep


# pros - less memory / answert the question - does path exist?
# cons - can get slow


# good if you know if the node is in below

# time complexity O (|v|)
# space complexity O - depends on the implementation
